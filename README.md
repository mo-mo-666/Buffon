# Buffon's Needle App
This is a GUI application for simulating [Buffon's needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle), using tkinter. 

## Requirements
- Python3
- Numpy

## View


## Caution

I expect the length *l* of needles is **the same as or smaller than** the distance *d* between lines.
So, if *l* is larger than *d*, the estimation of Ï€ will be incorrect!
